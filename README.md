# Moving-object-detection-
Build a openCV algo that crops vehicles from video.
This is a small code where i used background substraction and thresholdiing contour area to detect a moving object. In the main code 
I used contouring to detect position and also crop those images which crosses a line.
This code can be used to collect specific data to be used in transfer learning.
